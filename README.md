# Assignments for Post Gradudate AI @EHB-VUB 2021-22

## Intro
The postgraduate AI aims to combine theory and application of different disciplines within the AI landscape.
My endeavours for the practical assignments are reflected here.
These endeavours are to be considered as investigations, proof of concepts and personal opinions.
For the coding assignments, these have no intention at all to be reusable or production ready.

## Modules

### Introduction to AI
This orientation module was concluded with the writing of a paper describing a personal view on one of the AI milestones.
With a small group of 3 persons, we chose to investigate the CYC project ([the paper](./overview/cyc.pdf)).

### Data Science
This module focuses on data understanding, exploration, cleaning, integration, reduction, etc to prepare for ML. The two fold assignment was to create Jupyter notebooks explaining the process for ([detailed description](./data-science/Data%20Science%20Assignment%2021-22.docx)):
 * Creation of SMS spam filter ([notebook](./data-science/Assignment_1_spam_BTI.ipynb))
 * Prediction of forest fires ([notebook](./data-science/Assignment_2_forest_fires_BTI.ipynb))

### Machine Learning
This module focuses on understanding, applying and evaluating supervised, unsupervised learning, neural networks and reinforcement learning. The assigment was to predict the symboling value of a car. The notebook can be found [here](./machine-learning/ML-assignment-cars.ipynb).

### IOT & Big Data
At the EHB premises, temperature and light sensors are installed at different locations. The assigment was to create a system that was able to collect data from all these devices and enrich, transform and store it. Once stored, a ML model had to be created to predict temperature and light (eventually the idea will be to create an AI based light and heating control system that minimize energy costs once the necessary data/infrasture is in place). The implementation can be found [here](./IOT).

### Intelligent Interfaces
This module focuses on AI techniques that can be used to interact in a more natural and personalized way with computer system (vision, speech, text, recommender systems, etc...). 

For our assignment, we chose to implement a browser based rock, paper, scissors game with the help of face and hand gesture recognition, partially controlled by speech commands. 

You can find the implementation [here](./II/app) 

Off course you can [play rock, paper, scissors](https://bartimer.github.io/pg-ai/#/intelligent-interfaces)

### Robotics

This module combines robotics and AI with a focus on computer vision and reinforcement learning. For the assignment, we need to learn a robot arm to navigate to a location, pointed out by clicking on a live camera view of the robot arm. 

You can find the implementation [here](./robotics)
