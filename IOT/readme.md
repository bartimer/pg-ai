## IOT & Big data assignment

For the IOT & Big data module within the postgraduate on AI @ EHB I had to demonstrate that I was able to
1. Connect to an MQTT broker, process and enrich the message and persist that transformed information
    * The application server code (Python Flask) can be found in [flask](./flaskr)
2. Use the information of the IOT devices and do some predictions on that
    * The Jupyter notebook can be found [here](./IOTAssignment.ipynb)
1. Visualize all this information in a UI
    * The web application can be found [here](./app/src)

## Demo (recorded)
The server side code is not hosted at a publicly available domain.

You can run the code locally or you can see the demo and a walkthrough of the implementation in this [video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120823/155517492-061b58d6-2bb5-4dd3-ba29-e5d9fa10ad0c.mp4)
