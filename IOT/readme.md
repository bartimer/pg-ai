## IOT & Big data assignment

For the IOT & Big data module within the postgraduate on AI @ EHB we have to demonstrate that we are able to
1. Connect to an MQTT broker, process and enrich the message and persist that transformed information
    * The application server code (Python Flask) can be found in [flask](./flaskr)
2. Use the information of the IOT devices and do some predictions on that
    * The Jupyter notebook can be found [here](./IOTAssignment.ipynb)
1. Visualize all this information in a UI
    * The web application can be found [here](./app/src)
